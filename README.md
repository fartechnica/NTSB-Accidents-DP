The NTSB Accidents DP project aims to develop a comprehensive and structured dataset of aviation accidents and incidents from the year 2000 to the present. This dataset will be sourced from authoritative organizations, including the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Aviation Safety Network (ASN), and Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), supplemented with verified data from open-source repositories. The project will involve data extraction, cleaning, and standardization to ensure consistency and accuracy. The dataset will be stored in a relational SQL database, allowing for efficient querying, analysis, and reporting. The primary objectives include:

1. Creating a requirements specification document (RSD)
   - Defines the business and functional requirements of the database, including (project overview, business objectives and
     use cases, data sources and expected data volume, security and compliance requirements).
3. Creating a conceptual data-model document (CDM)
   - Represents high-level data relationships without technical details, including ERD, high-level data entities, general
     relationships between entities.
5. Creating a logical data-model document (LDM)
  - Converts the conceptual model into a detailed, structured form without specific database technology. Including tables,
    attributes and relationships, primary and foreign keys, data normalisation rules, business rules and constraints.
7. Creating a physical data-model document (PDM)
- Maps the logical model to PostgreSQL
8. Creating a data dictionary.
- Defines all data elements and their properties.
9. Database Schema Documentation
- Blueprint for database implementation.
10. Backup and Recovery Plan
  - Ensures database reliability and disaster recovery.
11. Performance and optimisation plan
  - Indexing strategies, query optimisation guidelines, partitioning and caching techniques.
